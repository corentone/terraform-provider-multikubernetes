## Schema

### Required

- `cluster` (String) Cluster to which apply the resource.

- `value` (Number) The value of this priority class. This is the actual priority that pods receive when they have the name of this class in their pod spec.

### Optional

- `description` (String) An arbitrary string that usually provides guidelines on when this priority class should be used.
- `global_default` (Boolean) Specifies whether this PriorityClass should be considered as the default priority for pods that do not have any priority class. Only one PriorityClass can be marked as `globalDefault`. However, if more than one PriorityClasses exists with their `globalDefault` field set to true, the smallest value of such global default PriorityClasses will be used as the default priority.
- `preemption_policy` (String) PreemptionPolicy is the Policy for preempting pods with lower priority. One of Never, PreemptLowerPriority. Defaults to PreemptLowerPriority if unset.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) An unstructured key value map stored with the priority class that may be used to store arbitrary metadata. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/

- `name` (String) Name of the priority class, must be unique. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names

Read-Only:

- `generation` (Number) A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state.
- `resource_version` (String) An opaque value that represents the internal version of this priority class that can be used by clients to determine when priority class has changed. More info: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency
- `uid` (String) The unique in time and space value for this priority class. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#uids
